# NetCheck
A simple tool that displays the status of the network.

When making network changes I have often looked for a really simple program to tell me if a device is still connected to certain other devices.

There are already programs to do this but the key here was absolute simplicity.

NetCheck therefore aims to:
 - Read a config file for a set of hosts to ping
 - Allow easily adding more hosts
 - Pings those hosts periodically
 - Displays the result as a simple traffic-light on a UI
